/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Chancellor Minus - AI Portfolio
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only access their own profile data and the projects they own.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Projects are stored in `/users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}`. Each project contains a `userId` field to indicate ownership.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete projects they own.
 * - Listing projects is restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Project` entity denormalizes the `userId` to enable direct ownership checks without additional `get()` calls. This avoids complex queries and ensures efficient rule execution.
