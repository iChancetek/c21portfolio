/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Chancellor Minus - AI Portfolio
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Users can only access their own profile data and the projects they own.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Projects are stored as subcollections under each user's document: `/users/{userId}/projects/{projectId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user document.
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete projects they own.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed. Only listing of a user's own projects is allowed.
 * - Denormalization: Each project document contains a `userId` field, duplicating the user ID from the path. This is CRUCIAL for security because it allows project ownership to be validated without additional `get()` calls.
