/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Chancellor's AI Portfolio.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to projects, skills, and project skills,
 * while restricting write access to authorized users (e.g., admins via a backend function).
 * Contact form submissions are writeable by any authenticated user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project information.
 * - /skills/{skillId}: Stores skill information.
 * - /projectSkills/{projectSkillId}: Stores the relationships between projects and skills.
 * - /contactFormSubmissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}: Stores contact form submissions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted for projects, skills, and project skills to allow open browsing.
 * - Listing of contact form submissions is denied to prevent unauthorized access to personal information.
 * - Write access to projects, skills, and project skills is only granted through backend admin authentication.
 * - Contact form submissions can be created by any authenticated user.
