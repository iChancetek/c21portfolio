/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Chancellor's AI Portfolio.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides public read access to projects, skills, and project skills,
 * while restricting write access to authorized users (e.g., admins via a backend function).
 * Contact form submissions are writeable by any authenticated user.
 * Audit logs are write-only for authenticated users and read-only for admins.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores project information.
 * - /skills/{skillId}: Stores skill information.
 * - /projectSkills/{projectSkillId}: Stores the relationships between projects and skills.
 * - /contactFormSubmissions/{submissionId}: Stores contact form submissions.
 * - /auditLogs/{logId}: Stores audit trail of important user actions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for portfolio content.
 * - Write access for portfolio content restricted to backend/admin roles.
 * - Contact submissions can be created by authenticated users but not read publicly.
 * - Audit logs can be created by the system/authenticated users but only read by admins.
